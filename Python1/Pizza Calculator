# How do I ask a question? For example, how much pizza do I have?
pizzas = input("How much pizza do you have? ")
friends = input("How many friends do you have? ")

slices = 8 * pizzas / friends

# Why didn't that work?
pizzas = int(input("How much pizza do you have? "))
friends = int(input("How many friends do you have? "))

slices = 8 * pizzas / friends

# Now tell me how many slices each person gets
print(slices)

# Or
if slices < 1:
  print("That's not enough pizza!")
else:  
  print("Each friend gets " + str(slices) + " slices of pizza.")

Tell me how print works...
Tell me how input works...

Recap using the student's version of
print() say something
input() ask something

int() thinking of a number
str() thinking of a word

if / else when we are deciding what to do

NB: It is too soon to explain comments. Write on the whiteboard!
